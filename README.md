## Demo

<!-- Demo source: https://github.com/nvim-mini/assets/blob/main/demo/demo-move.mp4 -->

## Features

- Works in two modes:
    - Visual mode. Select text (charwise with `v`, linewise with `V`, and blockwise with `CTRL-V`) and press customizable mapping to move in all four directions (left, right, down, up). It keeps Visual mode.
    - Normal mode. Press customizable mapping to move current line in all four directions (left, right, down, up).
    - Special handling of linewise movement:
        - Vertical movement gets reindented with `=`.
        - Horizontal movement is improved indent/dedent with `>` / `<`.
        - Cursor moves along with selection.
- Provides both mappings and Lua functions for motions. See `:h MiniMove.move_selection()` and `:h MiniMove.move_line()`.
- Respects `v:count`. Movement mappings can be preceded by a number which multiplies command effect.
- All consecutive moves (regardless of direction) can be undone by a single `u`.
- Respects preferred column for vertical movement. It will vertically move selection as how cursor is moving (not strictly vertically if target column is not present in target line).

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.move').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:

- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one.
  mappings = {
    -- Move visual selection in Visual mode. Defaults are Alt (Meta) + hjkl.
    left = '<M-h>',
    right = '<M-l>',
    down = '<M-j>',
    up = '<M-k>',

    -- Move current line in Normal mode
    line_left = '<M-h>',
    line_right = '<M-l>',
    line_down = '<M-j>',
    line_up = '<M-k>',
  },

  -- Options which control moving behavior
  options = {
    -- Automatically reindent selection during linewise vertical move
    reindent_linewise = true,
  },
}
```
